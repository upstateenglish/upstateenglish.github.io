## Are Too Many People
## Going to College?
### Charles Murray
   
*They Say, I Say* (222-242)



### Joining the Conversation (242)
#### **Question 1**
The "I say" here is explicit: "too many people are going to college." We know *what* Charles Murray thinks. But *why* does he think this?

In the rest of his essay, he tells us why. Summarize his argument, noting all the reasons and evidence he gives to support his claims.



### Joining the Conversation (242)
#### **Question 2**
Is Murray right--are too many people going to college? If you disagree, why?

Whether or not you agree with him, do you find his argument persuasive?



### Joining the Conversation (242)
#### **Question 3**
In the middle of the essay is a lengthy narrative about someone who is trying to decide what to be when he grows up, an electrician or a manager.

What does this narrative contribute to Murray's argument? Where would the argument be without the narrative?
