# Summary and Analysis

* <span style="color: orange;">Summary</span>: a general overview of content.
* <span style="color: orange;">Analysis</span>: an interpretation of content.



"<span style="color: orange;">Summaries</span> identify the main points or highlights of a [text] and reproduce some details to explain those points" (*BTD* 41).



"In <span style="color: orange;">analysis</span>, you look beneath the surface of the text to understand and explain

* what it means,
* whether it is effective for its audience,
* what it implies beyond its stated goals, or
* how it compares to other related texts" (BTD 42).



## Annotating and Quoting a Text

* Read with the goal of summarizing in mind  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
* Highlight sentences that help you answer these questions:  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
	* What's the topic?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
	* What argument is being made?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
	* Are there supporting arguments for the main argument?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
	* What evidence is presented to support those arguments?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* Put the sentences you've highlighted into your own words. (This is called paraphrasing.)
