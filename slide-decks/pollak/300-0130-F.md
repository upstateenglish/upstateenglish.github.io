## Example: Intro
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">Although she's been raised in relative seclusion and may be naive, Evelina turns out to be much smarter than some of the people she encounters who consider themselves more sophisticated than she is.</div>


## Example: Intro
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">For example, when she and the Branghtons attend an opera with Madame Duval, Evelina actually enjoys the performance and tries hard to ignore the mindless prattle of the Branghton sisters to focus on a particular song.


## Example: Intro
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">On page 78 (about half-way down the page), she describes how the others make fun of her for doing so.</div>

<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 100%; font-weight: normal;">**Note**: if you were writing, instead of speaking, you would put the page number in a parenthetical citation rather than in the sentence itself.</p>


## Example: Quote
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">&ldquo;I lean'd my head forward to avoid hearing their observations, that I might listen without interruption, but, upon turning round, when the song was over, I found that I was the object of general diversion to the whole party; for the Miss Branghtons were tittering, and the two gentlemen making signs and faces at me, implying their contempt of my affectation.&rdquo;</div>


## Example: Relate
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">The others are too coarse to appreciate the artistry of the opera, and too ignorant to realize that someone might actually find beauty in the performance of an opera. For them, the only reason someone would appear to be enjoying themselves at such an event would be &ldquo;affectation,&rdquo; pretending to be more sophisticated and fashionable than they really are.</div></div>


## Example: Restate
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">As we see here, Evelina is not stupid, and she's not unperceptive. She's just inexperienced at urban entertainments (and many other things). However, she shows with this passage that she's smart enough to realize that she's not doing anything wrong, just that there are certain unpleasant conventions for how to behave when out in public in London.</div>
