<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 100%; font-weight: normal;">In response to a 2004 "media summit" on obesity in America Radley Balko wrote an opinion piece arguing in favor of individual responsibility and against government intrusion into our personal lives. Balko, a senior editor at the libertarian periodical _Reason_, argues that "[w]e're becoming less responsible for our own health and more responsible for everyone else's" (396). In other words, Balko believes that America is at risk of becoming a society where we're expected to be more concerned about other people's diet more than we are about our own. This statement is an example of the kind of exaggeration that is found throughout this essay.</div>
