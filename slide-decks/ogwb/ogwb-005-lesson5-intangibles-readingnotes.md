# OWGB Lesson 5 Intangibles

## Who writes the grant proposal?

* "The person who writes proposals may be a founder of the organization, an executive director, an assistant commissioner, a program director, an assistant commissioner, a program director or program staff member, a board member, a development director or development associate, a designated grant writer on staff, or a consultant" (80).
* "Some organizations and agencies use a team approach" (80).

## Writing a grant proposal is challenging enough -- how can I make things a little easier on myself?

* "Beware of internal politics!" (81)
* Don't waste time. Hit your deadlines. (82)
* "Be organized" (82)
* Get along with other people involved so that collaboration on proposal happens more easily (83).
* "Be technologically savvy" (83). "In small and medium-sized organizations, grant writers may wear many hats: you may handle the website, the Facebook page, the Twitter account, the newsletter" (84).
* "Focus on the big picture" -- "You have to look at each grant opportunity in light of the organization's mission, its long-term needs, and its sustainability, not only in light of the immediate need to get money to keep a program alive." -- "be prepared to advocate for the appropriate grants internally and maybe externally, and to explain why others are not appropriate (84).

## But how do I get people to participate?

* "Engage the decision makes" -- "talk with the executive director an/or the person who will be directly responsible for implementing the grant" (85).
"Get off on the right foot: the kickoff meeting" -- "The kickoff meeting should be carefully planned (there are those good organizational skills again) to elicit this information and engage the participants in the proposal process" (85).
** Create a "very specific agenda" and share it ahead of time with the participants (86).
** "It will help you control the flow of information and the time allotted for the meeting if you organize the discussion around the main components of a proposal -- need or program statement; the program to address the need, including specific goals and objectives; the budget; and plans for evaluation" (87).
** "Timeline / due dates / responsibilities" (88).
** "Next steps" (88).
** "Sign-in sheets" (88).

## Intangibles that don't appear in the application package .. and why they are left out (could it be that they seem too obvious?)
* "Know the grant maker" (88).
* "Don't be greedy!" (89).
* "But be fair and realistic about salaries (and other costs)" (90).
* "Include in-kind contributions" (90).
* "Be honest!" (90)
* "Enhance the organization's reputation" (90).
* "Think about the reader" (91).
* "Watch your language" (91).
* "Build relationships with funders well before you apply for grants" (91).
* "Keep up with the news!" (92).
