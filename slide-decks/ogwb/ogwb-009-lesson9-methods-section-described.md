# Methods Section
## <span style="color: orange;">Part of the package</span>
---
* Problem Statement section identifies what needs to change  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Goals & Objectives section defines what that change will be  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Methods section explains how that change will be made  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Evaluation section establishes how you will know if you have been successful  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">What goes in the methods section?</span>
---
Methods &mdash; also called strategies &mdash; are detailed descriptions of the activities an organization will implement to achieve the ends specified in the objectives.



## <span style="color: orange;">Why do I need a methods section?</span>
---
The methods section of the proposal systematically walks the funder through the strategies the organization proposes to carry out in order to accomplish its objectives.



## <span style="color: orange;">The methods section should answer these questions:</span>
---
1. What activities will be carried out in order to meet the objectives?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. What are the starting and ending dates of these activities?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Who has responsibility for completing each activity?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. How will participants be selected? (Not always applicable.)  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">The methods section should also answer these questions:</span>
---
1. How did you determine that these are the best methods to solve the problem?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Does your plan build on models already in existence?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. If it's different than models already in existence, why?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. If you chose to develop your own methods, why?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Consider a Timeline</span>
---
* For proposals with multiple objectives and methods, it is a good idea to include a timeline showing when each activity will start and finish.
* Example timelines are provided in OGWB Lesson 9 and WGSBS Step 5 



## <span style="color: orange;">How do I make sure that my methods section covers everything?</span>
---

* For each of your objectives, you should have one or more activities that are clearly designed to accomplish that objective.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* No matter how many objectives you propose to achieve, specific activities must be described for each one.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Reminder</span>
---

* <span style="color: orange;">Problem Statement</span>: This is what needs to change in the community we serve.
* <span style="color: orange;">Goals & Objectives</span>: These are the specific things that we will change.
* <span style="color: orange;">Methods</span>: This is how we will bring about those changes.
