# OGWB Funders Roundtable I

## "Where do grant makers think we should begin?"

* **Research the foundation offering the grant**: what are their guidelines, what's their mission, who's their founder, who's on the board, what does their annual report say, who is the relevant program officer, who are their previous grantees?
* Check to see if you can talk with them ahead of time about application process. Some welcome a phone call or letter, and others do not. Be prepared with intelligent, relevant questions.
* Abide by the grant guidelines: show you're familiar with the guidelines, and follow the format that's specified. Research what projects were recently funded.
* Big City / Small Town: make sure you come across as knowing what you're doing.
* Small groups need a track record to be competitive: local contributions, documented volunteers, "in-kind contributions." Also, look for "start-up grants" designed for smaller organizations.
* If a foundation doesn't accept unsolicited proposals, "there's not much you can do." However, you can send them your org's newsletters and other info sources to get on their radar.
* It's not necessary to already know someone at the foundation in order to get funded.
* Govt grants: letter from elected official won't hurt, but won't really help, either.
* Intangibles: 1) frame your proposal in the bigger context of which it is a part; 2) your proposal should convey your org's commitment / passional; 3) document design matters: headings, bullets, visuals (but not too glossy).
* Explain everything clearly: don't assume reviewers already know what they need to know.
* Be persistent: don't expect every ask to be successful.
