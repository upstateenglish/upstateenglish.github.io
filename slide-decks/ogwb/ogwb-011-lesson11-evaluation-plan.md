<hr />

* <span style="color: orange;">Questioners</span>: Ask at least 2 questions about the material covered.
* <span style="color: orange;">Agreers</span>: Tell which points you agreed with or found helpful and explain why.
* <span style="color: orange;">Nay-sayers</span>: Tell which points you disagreed with or found unhelpful and explain why.
* <span style="color: orange;">Example givers</span>: Give specific examples or applications of the material.



## <span style="color: orange;">Why is evaluation important?</span>
<hr />

* To get future grants, you'll need to be able to provide an evaluation of prior activities.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* To know whether or not what you do matters, you'll need a plan for evaluating what you do.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Process Evaluation<br /> vs. <br />Outcome Evaluation</span>
<hr />

* Process evaluations, sometimes called formative evaluations, are used to assess the functioning of the project while it's still happening and provide feedback to allow for program corrections.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Outcome evaluations, sometimes called summative evaluations, measure outcomes once the project is over, program effectiveness, and the program's impact on the problem that it is designed to address.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Process Evaluation</span>
<hr />
Answers such questions as these:

* Are activities occurring when and where they should?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Are the right people being served?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Are the activities being implemented successfully?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Are participants satisfied?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* What could be done more efficiently, more effectively?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Outcome Evaluation</span>
<hr />
Answers such questions as these:

* Have program objectives been reached?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Has the community changed as a result of the program?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* What unanticipated results have occurred?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* What unexpected factors contributed to results?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* How cost-effective was the program?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* What have you learned from the program?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Build Evaluation Into Proposal</span>
<hr />

* Make explicit links between proposed activities and expected outcomes.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Be specific about quantitative elements of your program activities.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Anticipate what you might learn from negative results.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Explain how qualitative information will be gathered and used as well as quantitative data.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Evaluation Goals</span>
<hr />

* What midcourse changes were made to increase chances of success?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Did the program complete the activities originally proposed?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Did the activities reach the desired objectives? Why or why not?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* What was the impact on the community?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* What feedback was gathered from the community?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* Was the program budget accurate?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
