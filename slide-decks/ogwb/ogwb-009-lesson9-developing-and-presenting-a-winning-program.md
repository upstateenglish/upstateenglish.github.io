## <span style="color: orange;">How do I create a winning project description?</span>
---
<div style="text-align:left;">The project description &mdash; sometimes called a program description or a project plan &mdash; should <span style="color: orange;">show that you have a thoughtful, workable solution to the problem that you described in the problem statement</span>.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;">(Remember: The Problem Statement identifies what needs to change in the community you're serving.)</div>

## <span style="color: orange;">Why spend so much time on the project plan before the grant is even awarded?</span>
---
<div style="text-align:left;"Project plans are the blueprint of the project and the proposal. Problem statement leads to objectives, which lead to a plan of operation. <span style="color: orange;">Having all of these details increases the chances that you will achieve the objectives</span>.</div>



## <span style="color: orange;">How can I know whether certain activities will achieve the objectives?</span>
---
1. Either the one writing the grant proposal has the experience and has done the research to know what will work in the community, or,  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
