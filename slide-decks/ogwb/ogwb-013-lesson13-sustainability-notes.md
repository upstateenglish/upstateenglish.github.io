# OGWB Lesson 13 & WGSBS Step 7: SUSTAINABILITY

## What does sustainability refer to?

* long term viability of your project

## Why do funders care about sustainability?

* they can't fund you forever
* they want to know your project will continue

## How can you assure funders about sustainability?

* Other grantmakers are interested
* Long-term govt support available once program starts
* You're part of a larger project
* You've got experience with and commitment to fundraising
* You'll start charging modest feeds
* Community will help fundraise
* Grant will support things that have a life beyond the grant period

## Is it a mistake to request a grant to fund a program that really will end when the grant period is over?

* Can be a project to create a finished product (e.g. a book, a film, a building, an event)
* Can be a model for others to emulate
* Can be undertaken with *hope* that new funding opportunities arise

## Essay Question:

Let’s say you want to show that you will sustain a literacy program for immigrants in your community if the Love Foundation gives you a grant to cover the first year. How will you convince the foundation that your program isn’t a “one-year wonder”?
