# <span style="color: orange;">Evaluation</span>
<hr />

* Was the program successful?
* Did it do what was intended?
* What impact did the program have on the community?
* What did the organization learn from the program?
* What didn't work? Why?
* What's different in the community as a result?



# <span style="color: orange;">Listening Teams</span>
<hr />

* <span style="color: orange;">Questioners</span>: Ask at least 2 questions about the material covered.
* <span style="color: orange;">Agreers</span>: Tell which points you agreed with or found helpful and explain why.
* <span style="color: orange;">Nay-sayers</span>: Tell which points you disagreed with or found unhelpful and explain why.
* <span style="color: orange;">Example givers</span>: Give specific examples or applications of the material.




# <span style="color: orange;">Evaluation Plan</span>
## <span style="color: orange;">How Can You Be Sure if Your Program Worked?</span>
<hr />
## OGWB Lesson 11 & WGSBS Step 6



## <span style="color: orange;">Why is evaluation important?</span>
<hr />

* To get future grants, you'll need to be able to provide an evaluation of prior activities.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* To know whether or not what you do matters, you'll need a plan for evaluating what you do.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Which grant proposals need an evaluation plan?</span>
<hr />

<div style="text-align:left;">Every grant proposal should discuss how a program will be evaluated. It's important to describe to a funder how you will know if the program is working, and what you'll do if it's not.</div>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">When should an evaluation plan be created?</span>
<hr />

<div style="text-align:left;">The best time to think about the evaluation is <span style="color: orange;">when you're first designing a program</span>, when you can select those outcomes and indicators that will indicate that the program is working.</div>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">How is the evaluation related to other parts of the proposal?</span>
<hr />

<div style="text-align:left;">The evaluation plan should be viewed as an important element of the proposal, linked in an orderly way to the objectives as well as to the activities planned to achieve those objectives.</div>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Process Evaluation vs. Outcome Evaluation</span>
<hr />

* Process evaluations, sometimes called formative evaluations, are used to assess the functioning of the project and provide feedback to allow for program corrections.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Outcome evaluations, sometimes called summative evaluations, measure outcomes, program effectiveness, and the program's impact on the problem that it is designed to address.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Process Evaluation</span>
<hr />
Answers such questions as these:

* Are activities occurring when and where they should?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Are the right people being served?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Are the activities being implemented successfully?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Are participants satisfied?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* What could be done more efficiently, more effectively?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Outcome Evaluation</span>
<hr />
Answers such questions as these:

* Have program objectives been reached?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Has the community changed as a result of the program?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* What unanticipated results have occurred?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* What unexpected factors contributed to results?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* How cost-effective was the program?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* What have you learned from the program?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Build Evaluation Into Proposal</span>
<hr />

* Make explicit links between proposed activities and expected outcomes.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Be specific about quantitative elements of your program activities.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Anticipate what you might learn from negative results.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Explain how qualitative information will be gathered and used as well as quantitative data.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Evaluation Goals</span>
<hr />

* What midcourse changes were made to increase chances of success?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Did the program complete the activities originally proposed?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Did the activities reach the desired objectives? Why or why not?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* What was the impact on the community?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* What feedback was gathered from the community?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* Was the program budget accurate?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
