# <span style="color: orange;">Listening Teams</span>
<hr />

1. <span style="color: orange;">Questioners</span>: Ask at least 2 questions about the material covered.
2. <span style="color: orange;">Agreers</span>: Tell which points you agreed with or found helpful and explain why.
3. <span style="color: orange;">Nay-sayers</span>: Tell which points you disagreed with or found unhelpful and explain why.
4. <span style="color: orange;">Example givers</span>: Give specific examples or applications of the material.



## Rule 1
# <span style="color: orange;">Make an Outline</span>
<hr />

* Use subheads for each topic in the outline to make sure you don't lose your way.
* Before you start filling in the outline, organize the material you have available.



## Rule 2
# <span style="color: orange;">Write as You Speak</span>
## <span style="color: orange;">(or as You Should Speak)</span>
<hr />

Don't be too formal, but don't be too casual, either.



## Rule 3
# <span style="color: orange;">Double-Think Your Choice of Words</span>
<hr />

* Avoid slang
* Avoid insensitive language
* Avoid unnecessary jargon



## Rule 4
# <span style="color: orange;">Don't Exaggerate</span>
<hr />

* Let the facts speak for themselves.
* Avoid trying to emphasize how extraordinary your proposal or your organization is.



## Rule 5
# <span style="color: orange;">Follow Basic Rules of Grammar</span>
<hr />

* Language filled with errors will cause your readers to doubt your (and your organization's) competence.
* Keep a guide to grammar handy when you are writing.



## Rule 6
# <span style="color: orange;">Choose your words wisely</span>
<hr />

* A dictionary will help you make sure a given word means what you think it means.
* A thesaurus will help you expand your vocabulary and avoid repetitious language.



## Rule 7
# <span style="color: orange;">Stick to the Active Voice</span>
<hr />

* Use the active voice to be clear about responsibilities and activities.
* For example, not "The children will be tutored each afternoon" (passive voice) but "Community volunteers will tutor the children each afternoon" (active voice).



## Rule 8
# <span style="color: orange;">Keep Your Own Voice Out of It</span>
<hr />

* You're writing from the point of view of the organization, not from your point of view as an individual.
* Avoid making political statements, expressing controversial ideas, or using inappropriate humor.



## Rule 9
# <span style="color: orange;">Limit the Adjectives</span>
<hr />

* Adjectives can be vague, unsupported opinion. (e.g. "high-quality" or "cutting edge.")
* Any descriptions used should convey meaning clearly to the reader. (e.g. "praised by the U.S. Department of Education" or "has a success rate of over 85 percent.")



## Rule 10
# <span style="color: orange;">It's Not Personal</span>
<hr />

* Avoid first-person pronouns such as "I," "my," "we," and "our."
* Refer to the program and any associated staff in the third person.



## Rule 11
# <span style="color: orange;">Brevity <br />Isn't Always <br />the Soul of Wit</span>
<hr />

* Avoid using unfamiliar abbreviations and acronyms: spell things out.



## Rule 12
# <span style="color: orange;">Prove It!</span>
<hr />

* Provide evidence of any assertions that you make, whenever possible.
