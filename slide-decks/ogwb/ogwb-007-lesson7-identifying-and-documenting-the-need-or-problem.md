## Answer this question:

---

### <span style="color: orange;">Why would a grantmaker give money to my organization?</span>

* What is the problem your organization will solve?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* What is the need your organization will meet?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Do your plans match up with what the grantmaker values?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">A great program idea<br />is not enough</span>

---

* Provide evidence of a problem or need that your program answers.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> 
* The problem or need should be in line with what the grantmaker is concerned with.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Document the need, 1</span>

---

How do I prove there's a compelling problem<br />that deserves a grant?

* Present evidence that you find through experience or research.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Research the issues so that you can document the existence of the problem.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Consult "Appendix 6" of OGWB for some research suggestions.<br />  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> <a href="http://docs.upstateenglish.org/371/371-links.html">See also "A few links for community / need / problem research"</a>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Document the need, 2</span>

---

What kinds of information should I look for?

* Relevant and up-to-date research, trends, and literature (<a href="http://uscupstate.libguides.com/az.php">Library resources</a>, including but not limited to <a href="http://uscupstate.libguides.com/Scholarly_Journals">scholarly journals and other periodicals</a>.)
* A variety of economic and demographic statistics about the community, including the latest census data  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

### <span style="color: orange;">Does every grant application include a question about need?</span>

---

* Not necessarily.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Consult grant guidelines.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Even if not required to, include some information about need.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Parts of a Problem Statement</span>

---

What are the components of<br />a strong needs section or problem statement?

* Do not include a description of your program or project idea. That information is provided later in other parts of the grant proposal package.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Parts of a Problem Statement</span>

---

What are the components of<br />a strong needs section or problem statement?

* Compelling and specific information about the problem or need with documentation of where it came from.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Target population: who will the grant benefit, and what relevant information can you share about them?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Context  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
	* Compare local trends to statewide or national trends  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
	* Compare current trends to historical trends  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Feds and National Foundations</span>

---

Are proposals different for<br />the federal government and national foundations?

* They'll need more information than a local or state-level grantmaker who is likely to already be familiar with the conditions of the community you serve.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->



## <span style="color: orange;">Problem Already Defined?</span>

---

What if the grantmaker has identified the problem for me?

* You'll still need to describe the problem or need in a way that connects your specific program idea to the community you serve.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
