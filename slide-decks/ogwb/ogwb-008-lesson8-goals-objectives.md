At the end of the grant-funded period...

* ...what will be different?

## <span style="color: orange;">What's the difference between goals & objectives?</span>
---

* Goals normally refer to <span style="color: orange;">broad, long-term intentions</span>.
* Objectives are <span style="color: orange;">specific outcomes that can be expected</span> from the project.



## <span style="color: orange;">Why are goals & objectives needed?</span>
---

* They're needed because the value of your proposed program is in what it will accomplish.
* They're needed because your proposed program will be evaluated according whether or not it has achieved its objectives.

* <span style="color: orange;">**Objective**:</span> Fifty percent of our Asian/Pacific Islander audience will increase their attendance from one show per year to two shows by end of the year.

## <span style="color: orange;">More about objectives...</span>

Objectives must be SMART

* Specific,
* Measurable,
* Attainable,
* Relevant, and
* Time bound.



## <span style="color: orange;">Consider the grantmaker's goals & objectives</span>
---

* Make sure that you've chosen a grantmaker with goals and objectives that are compatible with (or the same as) your own program's.



## <span style="color: orange;">But don't tailor your program to the grantmaker's goals & objectives!</span>
---

* Your proposed program should set its own goals & objectives based on what you want to accomplish, not based on what you think will bring in the money.
* You can, however, describe what you're doing in ways that make it clear your program will meet the funder's objectives, too.



## Objectives Should Be <br /> <span style="color: orange;">S.M.A.R.T.</span>

* Specific: Do they clearly explain what the change the organization wants will be? Are they action oriented?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Measurable:  Do the objectives help everyone know precisely when the goal(s) have been reached?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Achievable: Will the organization be able to make the change it envisions within the defined time?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Relevant: Are the objectives results-oriented and rewarding to the organization, its funder(s), and the community being served?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Time-bound: What is the deadline for reaching the change envisioned?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
