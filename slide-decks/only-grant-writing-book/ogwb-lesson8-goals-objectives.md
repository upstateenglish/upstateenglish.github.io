## <span style="color: orange;">What's the difference between goals & objectives?</span>
<hr />

* Goals normally refer to <span style="color: orange;">broad, long-term intentions</span>.
* Objectives are <span style="color: orange;">specific outcomes that can be expected</span> from the project.



## <span style="color: orange;">More about objectives...</span>
<hr />
Objectives must be

* Concrete and specific,
* Measurable,
* Realistic,
* Attainable, and
* Time bound.



## <span style="color: orange;">Why are goals & objectives needed?</span>
<hr />

* They're needed because the value of your proposed program is in what it will accomplish.
* They're needed because your proposed program will be evaluated according whether or not it has achieved its objectives.



## <span style="color: orange;">Consider the grantmaker's goals & objectives</span>
<hr />

* Make sure that you've chosen a grantmaker with goals and objectives that are compatible with (or the same as) your own program's.



## <span style="color: orange;">But don't tailor your program to the grantmaker's goals & objectives!</span>
<hr />

* Your proposed program should set its own goals & objectives based on what you want to accomplish, not based on what you think will bring in the money.
* You can, however, describe what you're doing in ways that make it clear your program will meet the funder's objectives, too.
