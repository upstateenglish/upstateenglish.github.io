# English 318: Storify a Current Event or Topic

In today's class, we'll learn to create resources with [Storify][2], a tool you can use to "curate social networks to build social stories, bringing together media scattered across the Web into a coherent narrative." 

Students should go to [Storify.com](http://www.storify.com), sign in to their account (or sign up for an account, if they haven't done so already), and then start experimenting to see what you can do with this tool.

**Homework to be completed before 11:59pm on Wednesday, September 24:**

Create a Storify story on a topic of your choice, adhering to the following instructions:

1. Incorporating content from at least 2 different social media sources (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr, Instagram, & etc.),

2. Incorporate content from at least 2 different web sites (e.g. the web site hosted by a news organization, a college or university, a nonprofit organization, a government agency, a discussion forum, & etc.),

3. Be sure to incorporate your own commentary & section headings as necessary, and

4. Finally, share your story in a Tweet, using the `wide318` hashtag as well as any other appropriate hashtags relevant to your topic, and

5. Be prepared to talk about your story when you come to our next class meeting.

To familiarize yourself with the service, you might want to start with [this guided tour](http://storify.com/tour). Alternately, watch this video:
