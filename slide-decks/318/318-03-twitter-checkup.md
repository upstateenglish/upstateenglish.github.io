# English 318: Checkup for Twitter Assignment

Take some time to evaluate whether or not you are fulfilling the  assignment well: 

1. For the “website” section of your Twitter bio, use your student web site address.

2. Does your bio explain who you are and what your interests are?

3. Are you following accounts that post content that is interesting to you because of tour major, your hobbies, and/or your concerns about the world at large? Are you interacting with those accounts in meaningful ways? (Replies, Questions, Re-Tweets, Modified-Tweets, Favorites…)

4. Are you posting at least 5 Tweets per week?

5. Do you understand the difference between thick Tweets and thin Tweets? Are you posting thick Tweets or mostly thin Tweets?

6. **Be interesting**: Is your Twitter account interesting? (How to know that what you’re posting is interesting: other people — not just other students or spam bots — follow you and other people reply to you or favorite your Tweets or re-Tweet your Tweets.)

7. **Be interested**: Are you learning things of value from the accounts you follow? Can you think of specific examples?

8. **Be generous**: Can you provide examples of where you have responded to others, answered questions, and / or shared helpful or interesting links? (And not just with other students in the course.)

9. **Use hashtags**; Are you using hashtags to add meaningful metadata to your Tweets and to signal to other people on Twitter that you’re writing about a particular topic? If so, which hashtags have you used? What has been the result of using them? For example, have you attracted new followers? Have your hashtagged Tweets been favorited? Have they been been re-Tweeted?

10. **Experiment**: In what ways have you explored the creative possibilities of this relatively new medium? What have you done that you haven’t seen others do?
