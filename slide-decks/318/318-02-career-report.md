# English 318: Career Report        

* **Due date 1:** Draft for workshop on Tuesday, September 26
* **Due date 2:** Revised draft for grading on Thursday, September 28

## Purpose

This assignment will give you structured practice in what you already are (or should be) doing:  thinking critically about the relationships connecting your employment history, academic program, and career goals.  The process of reflection, research, drafting, and revision will provide you with an opportunity to shift from a personal and informal account to a more formal report.  

## Structure

You should begin with a brief summary statement declaring your personal and professional goals, and describing your report as a whole.  While a provisional version of this might help you frame your early draft, it would be best to write this section last.  Then, you should offer a description of each of the three sections of the assignment:

  1. your employment history,
  2. academic program, and
  3. career goals.

Use subheadings to identify these different sections. These sections should be detailed, citing at least one source in each of the latter two sections, whether quoting from the academic catalog, our textbook, a reputable on-line source, or a newspaper article.  While you should make judicious use of sub-headings, clear transitions should guide the reader from one section to another, especially through introductory and concluding sentences.

## Format

Each sub-section should be titled appropriately and run 1 to 3 paragraphs, single-spaced, and block paragraphed with effective intratextual cues.  As your last section (i.e. section 4), you should include a list of works cited formatted in MLA style.
