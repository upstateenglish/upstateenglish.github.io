## Assignment Overview

As you have seen through the examples you’ve found and shared on Twitter, infographics are quickly becoming a legitimate and respected way to provide information in a condensed space, advocate for a particular issue, and/or market a product. They could also serve quite well as conference posters.

Using what we’ve read about best practices in designing infographics, we are going to create our own information-, data-, and statistics-driven infographics using the user-friendly online infographic creator, [Piktochart](http://piktochart.com "piktochart"). Here’s a little video about Piktochart: “[How to create a Piktochart infographic easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzI9RzvnwZA)”

Piktochart has an [excellent overview page](http://piktochart.com/product-features/ "piktochart overview"), a [detailed support section](http://support.piktochart.com/hc/en-us), and [clear video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFu_9xKHBzHQxVMdY8cOPi0OhKG0YhoLo "Piktochart video tutorials"). You’ll want to consult these resources while working on your infographics projects.

## Assignment Specifics

To complete this assignment each student will chose a topic or issue to be presented in their infographic.

### Requirements

Each infographic must meet the following requirements:

-   600px or 800px wide (800px is preferred)
-   have at least 3 blocks added to the length
-   include a combination of words, images, graphics, and numbers (the amount of each will be determined by your topic and goals)
-   follow the guidelines that we’ve read about best practices in creating infographics
-   include substantial adjustments to the default theme layouts
-   include images or graphics that you have uploaded (all photos found online must have a creative commons license)
-   employ icons and graphics which enhance the infographic’s visual metaphors
-   include links at the bottom to all material cited and images used
-   include a [creative commons license](http://www.creativecommons.org "Creative Commons License") of your choice

### Information Sources

All information you find to inform the creation of your infographic must come from an online source.

If you like, you can stick with the data about USC Upstate found at the College Portrait site (or found at other, reliable sources.)

Alternatively, if you would rather tackle another topic, feel free to do so. Please make sure the source is reliable and that the information up to date. Depending on your topic, some places to find data and statistics are:

-   [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oed.com "Oxford English Dictionary") (use on campus to avoid having to log in)
-   [Amazon.com Open Datasets](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets "Amazon.com")
-   [Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)](http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/)
-   [Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)](http://corpus.byu.edu/coha/)
-   [TIME Magazine Corpus of American English](http://corpus.byu.edu/time/)
-   [Corpus of American Soap Operas](http://corpus2.byu.edu/soap/)
-   [Pew Internet and American Life Project Surveys](http://www.pewinternet.org/Data-Tools/Get-The-Latest-Statistics.aspx "Pew Internet and American Life")
-   [Center for Disease Control](ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/ "CDC")
-   [Gapminder World Data](http://www.gapminder.org/data/ "Gapminder")
-   [United Nations Environment Programme](http://geodata.grid.unep.ch/ "United Nations Environment Programme")
-   [Data.gov](https://explore.data.gov/catalog/raw/ "Data.gov")
-   [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/# "US Census Bureau")
-   [Open Secrets Political Data](http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php "Open Secrets")
-   [StatSheet Sports Stats](http://statsheet.com/ "Statsheet")
-   [Infochimps Free Datasets](http://www.infochimps.com/search?view=list&price_category=free&has_categories=&dataset_type=&order=balanced&tags=&query= "Infochimps Free data")
-   [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/ "Million Song Dataset")

You can use them in combination with each other, or choose not to use any of these datasets. You can simply search for the topic or issue you want and can create your infographic from what you find. While you are required to have a combination of words, numbers, and images, your infographics do not need to be solely driven by statistics. One way to get started thinking about topics is to put them into the [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/ "Wolfram Alpha search engine") search engine. Watching the results appear is just as amazing as seeing the kinds of results it gives.

### Reflections

You will write a reflection (450 to 600 words):

1.  Discuss the goals of the infographic.
	* What is your objective for creative the infographic? To build awareness about a particular topic or issue? To advocate for change? To promote an opportunity or problem? To accomplish something else?
	* What parts of the infographic do you see enhancing your ability to accomplish your objective? How does an infographic allow you to do something that written text would not?
	* What did you want to do infographically to accomplish your objectives that you were unable to do as a result of limitations in the system and/or your own design skill limitations?


2.  Discuss how you applied (or attempted to apply) what you’ve learned about best practices in designing infographics?. Highlight at least 3 components of your infographic and how they are examples of best practices.
