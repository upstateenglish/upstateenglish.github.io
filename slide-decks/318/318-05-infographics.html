### Information Sources

All information you find to inform the creation of your infographic must come from an online source.

If you like, you can stick with the data about USC Upstate found at the College Portrait site (or found at other, reliable sources.)

Alternatively, if you would rather tackle another topic, feel free to do so. Please make sure the source is reliable and that the information up to date. Depending on your topic, some places to find data and statistics are:

You can use them in combination with each other, or choose not to use any of these datasets. You can simply search for the topic or issue you want and can create your infographic from what you find. While you are required to have a combination of words, numbers, and images, your infographics do not need to be solely driven by statistics. One way to get started thinking about topics is to put them into the [Wolfram|Alpha][23] search engine. Watching the results appear is just as amazing as seeing the kinds of results it gives.

### Reflections

You will write a reflection (450 to 600 words):

  1. Discuss the goals of the infographic. 

    * What is your objective for creative the infographic? To build awareness about a particular topic or issue? To advocate for change? To promote an opportunity or problem? To accomplish something else?
    * What parts of the infographic do you see enhancing your ability to accomplish your objective? How does an infographic allow you to do something that written text would not?
    * What did you want to do infographically to accomplish your objectives that you were unable to do as a result of limitations in the system and/or your own design skill limitations?

  2. Discuss how you applied (or attempted to apply) what youâ€™ve learned about best practices in designing infographics?. Highlight at least 3 components of your infographic and how they are examples of best practices.
