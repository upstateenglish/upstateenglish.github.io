# English 318: Twitter

## Getting Started

1. If you have not yet joined Twitter, join [Twitter][1].

[1]: http://www.twitter.com

2. Create a profile. 

	* Be sure to fill out the bio!

	* Replace the Twitter egg avatar with something else.

3. Leave the "Website" section of your bio empty for now. 

	* We'll return to this later.

4. Make your profile public. 

	* If you already have a twitter account that is private and wish to keep it that way, create a new account for this class.

5. Publish a Tweet with some content and with the `#wide318` hashtag so that others may find you.

6. Wait a couple of days and then find & follow all members (students and professor) of our class. 

	* Hint: [search](http://search.twitter.com) for `#wide318` to see who has been using it recently.

7. Get into the habit of checking Twitter at least once a day.

8. Look for (and follow) accounts that post content that is interesting to you because of 

	* Your major,
	* Your hobbies, and/or
	* Your concerns about the world at large.

9. Post Tweets regularly. At least 5 times per week (and not all at once).

10. Read "[The Difference Between Thin and Thick Tweets][2]," by David Silver 

	* Make sure your Tweets are a combination of "thick" and "thin."

	* If you don't understand the difference between "thick" and "thin" Tweets you will not do very well at this assignment.

	* Come talk with me 1-on-1 for help if, after re-reading Silver, you still don't understand.

## General Guidelines

Below are a few general guidelines for fulfilling your Twitter assignment: 

* **Be interesting:** post things that other people are going to want to read.

* **Be interested:** read what other people post. Find and follow Twitter accounts other than the ones maintained by members of this class: look for people, publications, institutions, and organizations related to your interests.

* **Be generous:** respond to others, answer questions, share helpful links.

* **Use [hashtags][3]** to get the most out of Twitter. 

	* Remember that that hashtag for this course is `[#wide318]`.

	* Look for, and use, other hashtags that are related to things of interest to you.

* **Experiment**, be creative, see what the possibilities of this relatively new medium are.

## Reflection, Self-Evaluation, Argumentation

At the mid-point of the semester, you will be asked to analyze your use of Twitter by using a web service called [Storify][4].

### Analyze Your Own Twitter Activity Using Storify

All students in this class are responsible for maintaining a presence on Twitter. The Student Twitter Assignment (see above) instructs you to post a variety of "thick" and "thin" tweets, to be interesting, to be interested, to be generous, to use hashtags appropriately, and to be creative, to experiment with this relatively new medium.

Make the case that you are good at using Twitter. Using [Storify][5], curate a selection of the best Tweets from you and those who have interacted with you to demonstrate that you're fulfilling the assignment well. Pick the most representative material from the beginning of the semester to the due date for this particular assignment.
