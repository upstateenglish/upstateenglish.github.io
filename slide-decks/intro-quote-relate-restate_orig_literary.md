<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 2em; font-size: 150%; font-weight: normal; font-family: Cambria, Serif;">Hamilton, Patricia L. &ldquo;Monkey Business: Lord Orville And The Limits Of Politeness In Frances Burney's Evelina.&rdquo; *Eighteenth-Century Fiction* 19.4 (2007): 415-440.</div>



<div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 85%;">In a journal entry in the spring of 1774, Frances Burney rendered her judgment of the newly published volume of letters that Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth Earl of Chesterfield, had written over a period of thirty years to his illegitimate son, Philip Stanhope, starting in 1738, when the boy was six years old. Burney observed that the letters are "extremely well written" and contain "some excellent hints for Education," but they tend towards making Chesterfield's son "wholly unprincipled" by "inculcating immorality; countenancing all Gentlemanlike vices; advising deceit, and exhorting to Inconstancy" (33). Although Lord Chesterfield's *Letters to His Son* was reviewed positively in the *London Magazine* and some of his advice excerpted in conduct manuals such as *The Polite Preceptor* (1776), Burney's verdict echoed the volume's generally negative reception. </div>
