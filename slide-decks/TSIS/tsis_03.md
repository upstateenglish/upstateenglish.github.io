## "As He Himself Puts It"
## <span style="color: orange;">The Art of Quoting</span>


To launch an effective argument you need to write the arguments of others into your text.


One of the best ways to do this is by not only summarizing what "they say," as suggested in Chapter 2, but by quoting their exact words.


Quoting someone else's words gives a tremendous amount of credibility to your summary and helps ensure that it is fair and accurate.


In a sense, then, quotations function as a kind of evidence, saying to readers: "Look, I'm not just making this up. She makes this claim and here it is in her exact words."


## Make sure that you

1. <span style="color: orange;">Choose quotations wisely</span>, with an eye to how well they support a particular part of your text, and
2. <span style="color: orange;">Surround every major quotation with a frame</span> explaining whose words they are, what the quotation means, and how the quotation relates to your text. 



## Quote <span style="color: orange;">Relevant</span> Passages
<hr />
Choose passages that will support your writing<br /> at the particular point where you insert them.



## <span style="color: orange;">Frame</span> Every Quotation
<hr />
Present passages in a way that makes their relevance<br /> and meaning clear to your readers.



## Avoid <span style="color: orange;">"Hit-and-Run"</span> Quotations
<hr />
Don't just quote a passage and then<br /> move on to writing about you next point.

## "Hit-and-Run"
<hr />
This writer fails to introduce the quotation adequately or explain why he finds it worth quoting.

- Who is Susan Bordo? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Where did this quotation come from? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- How is this passage connected to the writer's argument?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


Besides neglecting to say who Bordo is or even that the quoted words are hers, the writer does not explain how her words connect with anything he is saying. He simply drops the quotation in his haste to zoom on to another point.



## Use a <span style="color: orange;">"Quotation Sandwich"</span>
<hr />

<ul>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><span style="color: orange;">Top slice of bread</span>: the signal phrase introduces the quotation and provides some context as to where it came from.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><span style="color: orange;">The meat in the sandwich</span>: the quotation reproduces, exactly, the words from the passage in question.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><span style="color: orange;">Bottom slice of bread</span>: your follow-up statements explain why the quotation is important, and how it's connected to your argument.</li>
</ul>

## Let's try a <br /><span style="color: orange;">"Quotation Sandwich"</span>




### <span style="color: orange;">Top slice of bread</span>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em;">The feminist philosopher Susan Bordo deplores the hold that the Western obsession with dieting has on women. Her basic argument is that increasing numbers of women across the globe are being led to see themselves as fat and in need of a diet.</div>



### <span style="color: orange;">The meat</span>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">Citing the island of Fiji as a case in point, Bordo notes that <span style="color: yellow;">"until television was introduced in 1995, the islands had no reported cases of eating disorders. In 1998, three years after programs from the United States and Britain began broadcasting there, 62 percent of the girls surveyed reported dieting" (149-50)</span>.</div>



### <span style="color: orange;">The bottom slice of bread</span>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em;"> Bordo's point is that the West's obsession with dieting is spreading even to remote places across the globe. Ultimately, Bordo complains, the culture of dieting will find you, regardless of where you live.</div>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em;">Bordo's observations ring true to me because a friend of mine from a remote area in China speaks of the cult of dieting among young women there . . . </div>

<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X states, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">As the prominent philosopher X puts it, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">According to X, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X himself writes, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">In her book, [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;], X maintains that "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">Writing in the journal *Commentary*, X complains that "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">In X's view, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X agrees when she writes, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X disagrees when he writes, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X complicates matters further when she writes, "[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]."</div>


When adding such introductory phrases, be sure to use language that accurately reflects the spirit of the quoted passage. It is quite serviceable to write "Bordo states" or "asserts" in introducing the quotation about Fiji. But given the fact that Bordo is clearly alarmed by the effect of the extension of the media's reach to Fiji, it is far more accurate to use language that reflects her alarm: "Bordo is alarmed that" or "is disturbed by" or "complains." (See Chapter 2 for a list of verbs for introducing what others say.)

### *The bottom slice of bread*
(page 47)


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">Basically, X is saying [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">In other words, X believes [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">In making this comment, X argues that [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X is insisting that [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">X's point is that [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</div>


<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">The essence of X's argument is that [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;].</div>


This framing of the quotation not only helps to better integrate Bordo's words into the writer's text, but also serves to demonstrate the writer's interpretation of what Bordo is saying. While "the feminist philosopher" and "Bordo notes" provide basic information that readers need to know, the sentences that follow the quotation build a bridge between Bordo's words and those of the writer. Just as important, these sentences explain what Bordo is saying in the writer's own words—and thereby make clear that the quotation is being used purposefully to set up the writer's own argument and has not been stuck in just for padding or merely to have a citation.


## BLEND THE AUTHOR'S WORDS
## WITH YOUR OWN
<hr />

The above framing material works well because it accurately represents Bordo's words while at the same time giving those words the writer's own spin. Instead of simply repeating Bordo word for word, the follow-up sentences echo just enough of her text while still moving the discussion in the writer's own direction.


Notice how the passage refers several times to the key concept of dieting, and how it echoes Bordo's references to "television" and to U.S. and British "broadcasting" by referring to "culture," which is further specified as that of "the West."


Despite some repetition, this passage avoids merely restating what Bordo says. Her reference to 62 percent of Fijian girls dieting is no longer an inert statistic (as it was in the flawed passage presented earlier), but a quantitative example of how "the West's obsession with dieting is spreading…across the globe." In effect, the framing creates a kind of hybrid text, a mix of Bordo's words and those of the writer.


But is it possible to overexplain a quotation? And how do you know when you've explained a quotation thoroughly enough? After all, not all quotations require the same amount of explanatory framing, and there are no hard-and-fast rules for knowing how much explanation any quotation needs. As a general rule, the most explanatory framing is needed for quotations that may be hard for readers to process: quotations that are long and complex, that are filled with details or jargon, or that contain hidden complexities.


And yet, though the particular situation usually dictates when and how much to explain a quotation, we will still offer one piece of advice: when in doubt, go for it. It is better to risk being overly explicit about what you take a quotation to mean than to leave the quotation dangling and your readers in doubt. Indeed, we encourage you to provide such explanatory framing even when writing to an audience that you know to be familiar with the author being quoted and able to interpret your quotations on their own. Even in such cases readers need to see how you interpret the quotation, since words—especially those of controversial figures—can be interpreted in various ways and used to support different, sometimes opposing, agendas. Your readers need to see what you make of the material you've quoted, if only to be sure that your reading of the material and theirs is on the same page.


## HOW NOT TO INTRODUCE QUOTATIONS
<hr />

We want to conclude this chapter by surveying some ways not to introduce quotations. Although some writers do so, you should not introduce quotations by saying something like "X asserts an idea that" or "A quote by X says." Introductory phrases like these are both redundant and misleading. In the first example, you could write either "X asserts that" or "X's idea is that," rather than redundantly combining the two. The second example misleads readers, since it is the writer who is doing the quoting, not X (as "a quote by X" implies).

The templates in this book will help you avoid such mistakes. And once you have mastered such templates you probably won't even have to think about them—and will be free to focus on the important, challenging ideas that the templates frame.
