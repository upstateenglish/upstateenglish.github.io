### <span style="color: orange;">Reading for the Conversation</span>
<hr />
Don't just ask what the writer's argument is.

* What other argument(s) is the writer responding to?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Is the writer disagreeing or agreeing with something?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* If so, what?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* What is motivating the writer's argument?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->



### <span style="color: orange;">Deciphering the Conversation</span>
<hr />

* The writer is not writing in a vacuum.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* The writer is engaged with other writers.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


### <span style="color: orange;">Deciphering the Conversation</span>
<hr />

Ask yourself:

* What views is the writer responding to?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* and  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* How are the writer's views related to those other views?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


### <span style="color: orange;">EXAMPLE</span>
<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 115%; font-weight: normal;">If ever there were a newspaper headline custom made for Jay Leno's monologue, this was it. Kids taking on McDonald's this week, suing the company for making them fat. Isn't that like middle-aged men suing Porsche for making them get speeding tickets? Whatever happened to personal responsibility?</div>
<div style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2em; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">I tend to sympathize with these portly fast-food patrons, though. Maybe that's because I used to be one of them.</div>



### <span style="color: orange;">When the "They Say" is Unstated</span>
<hr />

* Some writers assume that their readers are already familiar with the views that they're responding to.
* Such writers do not name or summarize those views.
* <span style="color: orange;">**Example, page 149.**</span>



### <span style="color: orange;">"Nobody Has Talked About" This</span>
<hr />

Some writers start by asserting that they're writing about something no one has noticed before.



### <span style="color: orange;">Reading Particularly Hard Texts</span>
