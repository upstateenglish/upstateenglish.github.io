### *They Say, I Say* Chapter 3
<hr />
## "As He Himself Puts It"
## <span style="color: orange;">The Art of Quoting</span>


To launch an effective argument you need to write the arguments of others into your text.


One of the best ways to do this is by not only summarizing what "they say," as suggested in Chapter 2, but by <span style="color: orange;">quoting their exact words</span>.


Quoting someone else's words gives a tremendous amount of credibility to your summary and helps ensure that it is fair and accurate.


In a sense, then, quotations function as a kind of evidence, saying to readers: "Look, I'm not just making this up. She makes this claim and here it is in her exact words."


The main problem with quotation arises when writers assume that quotations speak for themselves.


Such writers fail to see that quoting means more than simply enclosing what "they say" in quotation marks.


Effective quoting means surrounding every major quotation with a frame explaining

1. whose words they are,  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. what the quotation means, and  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. how the quotation relates to what you're writing.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


The point to emphasize is that quoting what "they say" must always be connected with what you say.



## Quote <span style="color: orange;">Relevant</span> Passages
<hr />
Choose passages that will support your writing<br /> at the particular point where you insert them.



## <span style="color: orange;">Frame</span> Every Quotation
<hr />
Present passages in a way that makes their relevance<br /> and meaning clear to your readers.



## Avoid <span style="color: orange;">"Hit-and-Run"</span> Quotations
<hr />
Don't just quote a passage and then<br /> move on to writing about you next point.



<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em; ">Susan Bordo writes about women and dieting. <span style="color: yellow;">"Fiji is just one example. Until television was introduced in 1995, the islands had no reported cases of eating disorders.

## "Hit-and-Run"
<hr />
This writer fails to introduce the quotation adequately or explain why he finds it worth quoting.

- Who is Susan Bordo? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
- Where did this quotation come from? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- How is this passage connected to the writer's argument?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


Besides neglecting to say who Bordo is or even that the quoted words are hers, the writer does not explain how her words connect with anything he is saying. He simply drops the quotation in his haste to zoom on to another point.



## Use a <span style="color: orange;">"Quotation Sandwich"</span>
<hr />

<ul>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><span style="color: orange;">Top slice of bread</span>: the signal phrase introduces the quotation and provides some context as to where it came from.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"><span style="color: orange;">The meat in the sandwich</span>: the quotation reproduces, exactly, the words from the passage in question.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"><span style="color: orange;">Bottom slice of bread</span>: your follow-up statements explain why the quotation is important, and how it's connected to your argument.</li>
</ul>



## Remember our

## Let's try a <br /><span style="color: orange;">"Quotation Sandwich"</span>




### <span style="color: orange;">Top slice of bread</span>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em;">The feminist philosopher Susan Bordo deplores the hold that the Western obsession with dieting has on women. Her basic argument is that increasing numbers of women across the globe are being led to see themselves as fat and in need of a diet.</div>



### <span style="color: orange;">The meat</span>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal;">Citing the island of Fiji as a case in point, Bordo notes that <span style="color: yellow;">"until television was introduced in 1995, the islands had no reported cases of eating disorders. In 1998, three years after programs from the United States and Britain began broadcasting there, 62 percent of the girls surveyed reported dieting" (149-50)</span>.</div>



### <span style="color: orange;">The bottom slice of bread</span>
<hr />
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em;"> Bordo's point is that the West's obsession with dieting is spreading even to remote places across the globe. Ultimately, Bordo complains, the culture of dieting will find you, regardless of where you live.</div>
<div style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Serif; font-size: 125%; font-weight: normal; text-indent: 2em;">Bordo's observations ring true to me because a friend of mine from a remote area in China speaks of the cult of dieting among young women there . . . </div>
