<aside class="notes">Wait at least 30 seconds before moving on to the next slide.</aside>



**Group 1** 

<div>Although Tom Hanks' experience with community college is inspiring, on the other hand, one will only get out of the experience from what they put in.</div>




**Group 2**

<div>Tom Hanks supports Obama's proposal of free community college, because of his experiences at Chabot Community College. He argues that it is greatly helpful towards veterans, women of every marital and maternal status, and middle aged men. Although this sounds great, in reality, nothing is free. The impact of the proposal will affect our economy as a whole. Taxes will be raised.</div>




**Group 3**

<div>Tom Hanks says that two free years of Community College would be extremely beneficial to those who lack the funds to attend an expensive college, including war veterans. On one hand it would be a very good thing for those who can not otherwise afford to go to college. On the other hand, anything thing that the government funds, the government has control over and can allocate funds as they chose to, instead of towards what the school really needs.</div>




**Group 4**

<div>Tom Hanks, a famous actor who attended community college, is strongly in favor of free community college to all who qualify. On one hand it is a great idea for those who cannot afford college and who wish to further their education. On the other hand it would cause conflict regarding who would pay for it due to it's $60 billion dollar price tag.</div>




**Group 5**

<div>Tom Hanks, a well-known actor and producer, agrees with the idea that making community college free, would be very beneficial to everyone because community college made him who he is today. On the other hand, it would cause a huge debate on who would have to pay for it. It would be unfair for the people that actually have to pay for their college.</div>




**Group 6**

<div>Tom Hanks, an actor, producer, and director had the opportunity to attend a two year college for free. It was a very life changing experience, it made him what he is today.

**Group 7**

<div>Tom Hanks, a successful actor, believes that Congress should adopt the idea of free Community College because it will provide better opportunities. On the other hand, I personally believe that congress should not adopt the idea of free community college becauseâ€¦</div>



**Group 8**

<div>I say if community college was to become free some students wouldn't jump at the opportunity instead they would still choose to have the experience of being at a university , i also believe it would end up raising taxes and possibly putting people out of jobs. Others such as Tom Hanks believe community college would be a good idea.</div> 




**Group 9**

<div> Tom Hanks apparently assumes that the idea of free Community College would benefit people with financial disabilities because of their current situation. I believe that many people will take advantage of this and the people that actually need the free education won't be able to obtain it. </div> 




**Group 10**

<div> Tom Hanks believes in free community college for those who really need it and will benefit from it the most. In accordance with that as students in college we know how much the first two years can cost.</div>
