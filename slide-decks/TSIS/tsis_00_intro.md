## *They Say, I Say*
# Introduction:
# <span style="color: orange;">Entering the Conversation</span>



## Any activity requires a number of *<span style="color: orange;">basic moves</span>.*




## *Beginners* have to start with learning those moves.

### <span style="color: orange;">Then they move on to more advanced things.</span>




## *Academic writing* requires specific, basic moves

### <span style="color: orange;">However, beginning writers often don't know what those moves are.</span>




## *They Say, I Say* is "a short, user-friendly guide to the basic moves of academic writing."




# Templates

## A key feature of this book.




## What's a template?




*template example*

## Many Americans assume that <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.




*template example*

## On the one hand, <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>. On the other hand, <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.




*template example*

## Author <span style="color: orange;">[X]</span> contradicts herself. At the same time that she argues <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>, she also implies <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.




*template example*

## I agree that <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.




*template example*

## This is not to say that <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.




## These are <span style="color: orange;">some examples (among many)</span> of the kinds of *basic* moves that are involved in academic writing.




## Effective academic writing also requires more advanced skills.
### <span style="color: orange;">Before you do well at those, however, you must become skilled at the basics.</span>




*Most important template*
## They say <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>. I say <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.




*Present your ideas*
## <span style="color: orange;">(&ldquo;I say&rdquo;)</span>
*as a response to someone else*
## <span style="color: orange;">(&ldquo;They say&rdquo;)</span>




## Academic Writing
## is
## <span style="color: orange;">*Argumentative Writing*</span>




### In other words,
## academic writing <br />requires you to <span style="color: orange;">*argue well.*</span>




## To argue well, you must<br /> <span style="color: orange;">*do more than state your position.*</span>




## To argue well, you must <br /> <span style="color: orange;">*enter a conversation.*</span>




## You must<br />use what others say <br /><span style="color: orange;">*as your starting place.*</span>




## What this means:<br /><span style="color: orange;">*Put the voices of others into your own writing.*</span>




## The best academic writing is<br /><span style="color: orange;">*deeply engaged with other people's views.*</span>




## Without<br />engagement with others<br /><span style="color: orange;">*academic writing can be boring.*</span>




*Example*
## <span style="color: orange;">&ldquo;The characters in *the Sopranos* are very complex.&rdquo;</span>

*Result: So what? Boring*




*Use a temple to improve*
## *Some say <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>. In fact, however, <span style="color: orange;">[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span>.*




*Improved example*
## "Some say that <span style="color: orange;">*the Sopranos* presents caricatures of Italian Americans</span>. In fact, however, <span style="color: orange;">the characters in that series are very complex</span>."
*Result: now your audience knows there's something at stake. Now it's clearer why it matters whether or not they are complex.*




## There are a <span style="color: orange;">variety of strategies</span> for engaging others.
*See "Ways of Responding," starting on page 8*.



## *Writers are not <span style="color: orange;">required only to disagree</span> with each other.*



## *Consider the <span style="color: orange;">2-paragraph example on page 9.</span>*
